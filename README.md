<h3> Real time eye tracking </h3>
<hr>

The goal of this project is to track the movement of the human eye in real time through a webcam feed (lowres).

This task consists of 3 major steps:
  <ul>
  <li>  face-detection;
</li>
  <li>  eye-detection;
</li>
  <li>pupil-detection and tracking the pupil centers;</li>
</ul>
  
<hr>
The C++ source code implements all the above steps with the help of the OpenCV library.

In order to make the source code work, you have to have OpenCV installed and configured in a C++ environment.

The ligthing was calibrated specially for my own setup, so It might be difficult to reproduce. For this reasen I've made a demo video.
